## Others
- [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) or [Optifabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric)<br>
As stated in [additionals](./MeteorAdditionals.md), Optifine is and never will be compatible with Meteor.
More reasons as to why [here](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754).

- [Replay Mod](https://www.replaymod.com/)<br>
Only crashes when opening the replay list. Recording should still be fine.

Causes rendering issues such as custom font to not render correctly.
