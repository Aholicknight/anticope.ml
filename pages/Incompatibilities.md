As stated in [additionals](./MeteorAdditionals.md), Optifine is and never will be compatible with Meteor.
More reasons as to why [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives).

- [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins)<br>
The game crashes on start due to a mixin conflict.

- [Replay Mod](https://www.replaymod.com/)<br>
Only crashes when opening the replay list. Recording should still be fine.
