## Optifine Alternatives

Optifine is and never will be supported by Meteor.
More alternatives and the reason why its not supported [here](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754).

Server optimizations

- [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor)<br>
Lighting engine improvements

- [Starlight](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Starlight)<br>

## Misc

- [SeedMapper](https://github.com/xpple/SeedMapper)<br>
Adds useful tools that use world seed


## Meteor Addons

Meteor has a built-in addon system which allows creation of addons.
Addons can modify almost anything in meteor, modules, commands, gui, etc.

Check out the addons list [here](/MeteorAddons.md).

## Incompatibilities

If you are looking for the list of incompatible mods, check out the [Meteor Incompatibilities](/MeteorIncompatibilities.md) page.
