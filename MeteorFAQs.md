## How do I use the client?


### How do I open the GUI?

The default keybinding for opening the GUI is right shift, but you can change that in `pause menu > options > controls`.

Inside the gui, you left click to toggle a module and right click to configure that modules. 

### How do I activate HUD?

1. Activate the HUD Module in the render category.
2. Go to the HUD tab (the top of your screen)

3. If the hud elements are red, that indicates that they are **off**. To toggle them simply left click and right click to configure.

### How to prevent people noticing me using Meteor?

We **highly discourage** usage of Meteor on servers (such as hypixel) that forbid usage of utility clients like Meteor.
Meteor is built for anarchy servers, where usage of utility clients like meteor and alike are allowed (and encouraged).

If you insist, **nobody will help you in doing so**

## How to use meteor on 1.12.2/1.16.5/1.17 (older versions)


### I want to connect to a \<insert older version\> server!

Your only choice is to use multiconnect as older versions of meteor are unsupported.
1. Download [multiconnect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiconnect) and put it in your mods folder alongside meteor.
Your mods folder should look something like this 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72693226/129830229-51108c71-ea20-4172-b5c5-f9102e021b8d.png)

2. Launch fabric **for 1.17.1**. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72693226/129830462-b2167e40-1afd-4948-9c3e-fdb507bde839.png)

Don't launch fabric for an older version, that is not how multiconnect works. 
Multiconnect allows you to connect to older version servers (e.g. 1.12.2) while you are playing minecraft 1.17.1 with meteor.

### My other mods aren't on 1.17.1

If that mod is sodium, you are one of the many who didn't know sodium is **already** on 1.17.1. 
You can get it [here](https://modrinth.org/mod/sodium)

Otherwise, sadly you can't use latest version of meteor. 
Meteor relies on Circle CI, and storage on Circle CI isn't infinite. So older versions can't be kept. 
We **highly discourage** usage of older versions as it lacks better code, features and bug fixes that newer versions offer.

There exists an [archive](https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-archive) of historic meteor versions, 
however, if you wish to use it, be aware that **if you experience bugs or issues with it, no one will help you fix it**

## How to use Meteor with Optifine?

Optifine is and never will be supported by Meteor. We recommend using these instead,

- [Sodium](https://modrinth.org/mod/sodium) | Performance improvements (better than Optifine)
- [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium) | Server optimizations
- [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) | Lighting engine improvements

More alternatives and the reason why its not supported [here](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754).
*We recommend you read [this](https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-lists/blob/master/MeteorAdditionals.md) list of Meteor Addons too*

## How to use Meteor with Baritone?

Meteor comes with Baritone built in, you don't need to download a standalone baritone.
Baritone's default command prefix is `#` or you can use the Meteor command `.b`.
You can view all of Baritone's commands [here](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/blob/master/USAGE.md) 
and settings [here](https://baritone.leijurv.com/baritone/api/Settings.html).

## How to dupe with this client?

Finding dupes isn't an easy task. Public dupes get patched very quickly so alot of dupes are kept private.
You can check out [this](https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-lists/blob/master/MeteorAddons.md#duping) list of Meteor Duping addons.
Some might work, and some may not.

## Why am I muted in the Meteor Discord?

You most likely have broken one of the rules in the [#rules](https://discord.com/channels/689197705683140636/816501672477720626/) channel.

If you did not break a rule, then [this](https://discord.com/channels/689197705683140636/689198722097348624/870066829622652989) might explain why.
Due to the amount of users in the discord server increasing, public channels have been closed to only users who have roles. 

You can get a role by creating an account [here](https://meteorclient.com/account).
